What would a hackspace be without a place full of sofas to relax, calm down or talk to each other in a chillaxing environment?
For exactly this reason we have a lounge in the Toolbox.

Here you cannot only find sofas, electricty and WiFi but also a nerdy design of the walls that directly invites you to chill here.
