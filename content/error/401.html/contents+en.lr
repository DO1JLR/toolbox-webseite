First of all, try to commit more in the Toolbox community. 
Working on your own private projects is not sufficient.

Tell us what you do there and share your knowledge with other people. For example by giving a presentation or a workshop.

No worries - knowledge is something that doesn't shrink if you share it - actually the opposite is the truth!

If you do not have an idea how to help, do not hesitate to ask during the weekly meeting or in the chat for ideas.
