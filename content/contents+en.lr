red_1: We are happy to see new faces.
---
red_2:

Every Thursday evening, the door is open and everyone is welcome to come over and visit the Toolbox Bodensee e.V..<br/>
At 7 p.m. the "weekly meeting" takes place. Here we all meet for approximately 20 minutes in the large meeting room to ddress current topics, projects and questions. In addition, new faces and guests have the opportunity to introduce themselves or ask questions to the large group of people. E.g if they need help with a specific problem and do not know exactly who to turn to.
---
red_3: After the weekly meeting, often there is a small lecture where you are welcome to listen and thus broaden your knowledge horizon. For the rest of the evening, the living creatures are spread over all rooms of the Toolbox Bodensee e.V.. Some people continue to tinker with their projects, others have retreated into the lounge or the ball pit and talk, others are barbecuing in front of the Toolbox or flying with the drone through the Toolbox. Some of you may also have found the library and are immersed into reading. And others sit at their computers and program diligently.
---
red_4: We would be happy if you came around!
