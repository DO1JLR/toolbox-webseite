 Open Evening
------------------------

Our open evening usually takes place every Thursday.
At 7 p.m. there will be a short meeting in the Toolbox where current topics and important upcoming events will be discussed. 
In addition, everyone present has the opportunity to share ideas with the others, ask questions or find someone who is familiar with one of the tools or projects in the Toolbox. 
Ususally, the club house opens at 5:30 p.m., however, it doesn't hurt to check the status of the club house at the website first.

People then spend the rest of the evening exchanging ideas, tinkering with their projects, preparing food in the kitchen or having a barbecue with everyone, eating or simply relaxing somewhere in the Toolbox.

 Technology Camp

From the 1st to the 4th of August the Technology Camp is taking place at Lake Constance in Ãœberlingen.
