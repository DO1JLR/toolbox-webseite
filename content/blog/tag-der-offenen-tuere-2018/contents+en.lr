On 17 November 2018 the Toolbox Bodensee invites you to the 4th Open Day.

The open day is an ideal opportunity for all those interested to take a closer look at the Toolbox at Bergheimer Stra√üe 6 in Markdorf. 
Between 11:00 am and 7:00 pm we welcome our guests warmly.
Also this year there will be a varied program with many interesting lectures and workshops on different topics. Especially popular with visitors last year were our workshop on soldering for children and the Quadrocopter demonstrations. We will offer both again this year!
Also [Freifunk Bodensee](https://ffbsee.net/) will present itself again and give instructions for flashing your own freifunk router.

We also take care of your physical well-being. Among other things, the [C3WOC](https://c3woc.de) will, as always, prepare fresh waffles for us.
