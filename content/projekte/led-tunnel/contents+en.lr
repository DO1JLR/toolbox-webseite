In the Toolbox there are some people who are enthusiastic about FPV racing with drones.

And to have even more fun flying, people have built an LED tunnel that has become part of a small drones parkour.
It hangs above the stairs in the first floor.

 neopixels
----------------
The LEDs are 5 meters neopixels. These are controlled by a  ESP2866. It is attached to the wlan with auto ota firmware update.
The corresponding code can be found on GitHub: [github.com/ToolboxBodensee/led_tunnel](https://github.com/ToolboxBodensee/led_tunnel.git)

We would be very happy if you come by with your tiny class drone and try out the tunnel!
