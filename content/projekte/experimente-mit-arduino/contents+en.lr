An Arduino is a small computer board that is used to create exciting things.  Regardless of whether lights blink or a beeper beeps: With the Arduino, you can easily build an alarm system or control a small robot. We regularly build and program these and many more experiments in workshops for and with kids. And you don't need previous knowledge for this.

The event does always take place during the summer holidays. If you are interested or if you want your own date fixed with a group of people, feel free to get in touch with us.
