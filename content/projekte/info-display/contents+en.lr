body:

In the toolbox there is a large display in the aisle which is used to display useful and amusing information. In addition to the current time, nerdig [Memes](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internetph%C3%A4nomen) and videos, we also display the departure times for public transport.
A Raspberry Pi is connected to this display and is equipped with the software [info-beamer](https://info-beamer.com/product/info-beamer-pi). Info-beamer - as a very powerful "digital signage" solution - is also used at the [Chaos Communication Congress](https://info-beamer.com/blog/running-the-33c3-info-screens) of the CCC, for example, to display information on talks and lectures.

Directly below the display you will also find our Space-API switch, with which you can change the status of the toolbox (or the clubhouse). By pressing the button the information whether the clubhouse is currently open or closed will be updated directly on our website (top left).
